        <p class="lead my-3">I'm Joe Clark, a veteran software developer and analytics consultant based in northern and western Maine, and <span class="satisfy">Sandy River Software</span> is my consulting brand.  I was one of the first Maine web developers in the late 1990s, then went to work out west for NBC and Disney Online during the dot-com bubble.  I spent a decade in academia, earned a Ph.D. from USC, and taught courses on information systems and data analytics at Arizona State and UMaine between 2013 and 2019.  Now I'm hanging out my shingle as an independent consultant... call me at <strong>207-307-1457</strong> and let's see what I can do for you!</p>

                        Every business these days is at risk of cyberattack, and small-to-medium-sized businesses may be especially attractive targets for criminal hackers because of their often inadequate defenses.  I can help you identify your most meaningful risks and make a plan to mitigate them.
